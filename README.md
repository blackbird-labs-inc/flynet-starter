# Flynet Starter

A minimal Next.js app built on the [Flynet SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flynetdev/core).
Clone it, add an API key, and you have real Blackbird restaurant data rendering
through the SDK. Use it as the starting point for your own integration.

## Prerequisites

- Node 20 or newer
- npm
- A Flynet **Discovery API key** (request one through the Flynet developer portal)

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url> flynet-starter
cd flynet-starter
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local      # then set BLACKBIRD_API_KEY in .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

**You'll know it worked when** the page shows a list of real Blackbird
restaurants. Before you add a key, it shows a short setup notice instead of
crashing — that's expected.

## What's here

```
app/
  layout.tsx              imports the component theme (@flynetdev/react/styles.css)
  page.tsx                the whole flow: server-side Discovery + the member section
  member-panel.tsx        the member components (wallet, passport), client-side
  api/auth/login/         starts the OAuth authorization-code + PKCE flow (SDK FlynetOAuth)
  callback/               the registered redirect URI; exchanges the code, sets cookies
  api/auth/logout/        clears the session cookies
  flynet-proxy/           same-origin proxy for the browser-side member components
components/               Blackbird-branded building blocks (see below)
lib/auth.ts               shared OAuth config: scopes, cookie names, FlynetOAuth factory
middleware.ts             silent refresh: rotates the refresh token when the access token expires
.env.example              every variable explained
```

`page.tsx` reads your API key on the **server** and calls Discovery there, so the
key never reaches the browser. That is the one rule to keep: the Discovery API
key is server-only.

## Where your code goes

`app/page.tsx` has a marked spot:

```tsx
{/* 👉 Your code goes here. */}
```

Drop in another component, a new route, or your own logic. The full component
catalog and hooks (`WalletBadge`, `CheckInFeed`, `RestaurantCard`,
`NearbyLocations`, `useWallet`, …) are in
[`@flynetdev/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flynetdev/react).

## The component library

`components/` ships branded building blocks styled with the Blackbird design
tokens (wired into Tailwind via `tailwind.config.ts` + `app/globals.css` —
use the semantic classes like `bg-surface-low` and `text-muted`, never raw
hexes):

| Component | What it renders |
|---|---|
| `RestaurantCard` | A Discovery restaurant — photo with gradient protection, name, cuisine tags, price tier. Server-safe. |
| `UserCard` | The signed-in member — avatar (or monogram), name, email, account-status tag. |
| `Tag` | Pill label with `neutral` / `primary` / `success` / `failure` tones. |
| `BBPayButton` | Blackbird Pay — purple pill, optional USD amount. Wire `onPay` to your payment flow. |
| `LoginButton` | "Sign in with Blackbird" — bird mark on black, points at your OAuth start route. |
| `BirdMark` | The bird logo as an inline SVG (brand rule: black or white surfaces only, never purple). |

## The member section

The wallet and passport need a member token. There are two ways to get one:

1. **Sign in with Blackbird (default).** With `BLACKBIRD_CLIENT_ID`, `BLACKBIRD_CLIENT_SECRET`, and
   `REDIRECT_URI` set, the page shows a sign-in button. It runs the full OAuth
   authorization-code + PKCE flow server-side via the SDK's `FlynetOAuth`
   helper: tokens are stored in HttpOnly cookies, the access token auto-renews
   from the rotating refresh token (middleware), and `/api/auth/logout` signs
   out. `REDIRECT_URI` must exactly match a redirect URI registered for your
   OAuth app.

   > **Local dev needs a tunnel.** The staging edge rejects `localhost` /
   > `127.0.0.1` redirect URIs before they reach the OAuth server, so the
   > sign-in flow can't complete on a bare localhost URL. Run
   > `ngrok http 3000`, get `https://<your-subdomain>.ngrok.app/callback`
   > whitelisted for your OAuth app through the Flynet developer portal, set it
   > as `REDIRECT_URI`, and open the app through the ngrok URL — the session
   > cookies are host-scoped, so the whole flow has to run on that host.
2. **Pin a token.** Set `ACCESS_TOKEN` in `.env.local` (scopes `read:profile` +
   `read:wallets`) and it takes precedence — no sign-in needed. Staging tokens
   expire after 60 minutes, so this is for quick poking, not sessions.

The member components fetch from the browser, and staging only accepts
registered origins — so the starter routes those calls through a same-origin
proxy (`app/flynet-proxy/`).

## Switching environments

The starter targets **staging** by default. To run against production, set the
three optional env vars in `.env.local` — `API_BASE_URL`, `AUTH_BASE_URL`, and
`AUTH_AUDIENCE` (values in `.env.example`) — and swap in your production
credential set. Production access is gated by partner approval; you receive a
separate `client_id`, `client_secret`, API key, registered redirect URI, and
merchant id at production sign-off. Staging and production credentials are not
interchangeable. Everything else (the proxy, the OAuth routes, the payment
route) picks the environment up from those vars.

## Next steps

- **OAuth / member sign-in** — `concepts/oauth` in the Flynet developer portal
  (mirrored in `docs/llms.txt`).
- **All the components and hooks** — [`@flynetdev/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flynetdev/react).
- **Field-level API reference** — the Flynet developer portal.
